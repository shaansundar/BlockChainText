# BlockChainText
The Python program implements an API call to store your text files in an IPFS server!!!

Built with Python and TKinter, supposed to be an 'OS' related project, so added a little bit of local file handling up there.

## Execution:

run Main.py in a terminal....


Really, as simple as that ;)

## Known Bugs:

IPFS may time out, this may be due to the limit being crossed at the host's IPFS server. In that case, please create your own API key of any IPFS of choice and paste it in the `/file_menu.py` file by loacting the existing API key
